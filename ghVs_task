	v. Issues: For tracking bugs and enhancements.

"Version Control with Git:"
Explain the concept of version control in the context of Git. How does GitHub enhance version control for developers?
# Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Git, a distributed version control system, allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.

# Enhancing Version Control with GitHub:
	i. Remote Repositories: GitHub provides a remote repository to store and share code.
	ii. Collaboration Tools: Features like pull requests and issues enhance collaborative development.
	iii. Backup and Restore: Keeps a complete history of changes, enabling rollback if necessary.
	iv. Visibility and Transparency: Public repositories allow others to view and contribute to projects.

'Branching and Merging in GitHub:'
What are branches in GitHub, and why are they important? Describe the process of creating a branch, making changes, and merging it back into the main branch.
# Branches in GitHub:
	Branches are isolated development environments within a repository. They allow developers to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously without affecting the main codebase.

# Importance of Branches:
	i. Parallel Development: Multiple features or bug fixes can be developed simultaneously.
	ii. Isolation: Changes in a branch do not affect the main branch until merged.
	iii. Testing: Allows testing changes in isolation before integration.

# Process of Creating and Merging Branches:
# 1. Create a Branch:
	i. git checkout -b se(the branch name)
	ii. Make Changes: Modify files and commit changes in the new branch.
		git add .
		git commit -m "update of program"
	iii. Push Branch to GitHub:
		git push origin se
	iv. Create Pull Request: 
		git pull
	v. Review and Merge:
		Review the changes.
		Discuss and resolve any issues.
		Merge the branch into the main branch using the "Merge pull request" button.

'Pull Requests and Code Reviews:'
What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request.
# A pull request (PR) is a way to propose changes to a codebase. It allows developers to review, discuss, and approve changes before merging them into the main branch.

# Facilitating Code Reviews and Collaboration:
	Code Reviews: Team members can review changes, suggest improvements, and catch potential issues.
	Discussion: Enables discussion and clarification of changes.
	Approval Workflow: Ensures changes are vetted and approved before integration.

# Steps to Create and Review a Pull Request:
#1. Create a Pull Request:
	Push your branch to GitHub.
	Go to the repository on GitHub.
	Click "Pull requests" and then "New pull request."
	Select the base branch and compare branch.
	Add a title and description.
	Click "Create pull request."
#2. Review a Pull Request:
	Go to the "Pull requests" tab.
	Select the pull request to review.
	Review the changes, add comments, and request changes if necessary.
	Approve the PR if everything is satisfactory.
	Merge the pull request by clicking "Merge pull request."

'GitHub Actions:'
Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows. Provide an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
# GitHub Actions is a CI/CD service that allows you to automate workflows directly in your GitHub repository. You can build, test, and deploy your code based on events such as push, pull request, or on a schedule.

# Example of a simple CI/CD Pipeline
#1. Create a Workflow File
	Create a '.github/workflows/ci.yml' file
	Define the workflow
		name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
